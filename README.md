Instructions for running final assignment BC Ferries App.

    1. Create a postgresql database called "bcferries".
    2. Run "npm Install" in both the "finalAssignment" and in the "finalAssignment/bc_ferries_app" folder.
    3. Run "npm build" in the "bc_ferries_app" folder.
    4. Run "npm run seed" in the "finalAssignment" folder.
    5. Run "npm start" in the "finalAssignment" folder.
    6. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
    7. It is usual to see "error" for the data on the conditions pages, once the first scrape has been completed and the database has been successfully updated you         should start to see data.  
    8. Enjoy!
